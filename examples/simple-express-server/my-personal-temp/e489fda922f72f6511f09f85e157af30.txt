David Foster Wallace








Infinite Jest at 20: still a challenge, still brilliant






Finding my way around David Foster Wallace’s monumental maze of a story has ruined my social life and made my brain hurt – but its rewards are as big as its size, writes Emma-Lee Moss

An awful lot to read ... David Foster Wallace in 1996, with his books and his dog.

The first of February saw the 20th anniversary of a work considered by many to have changed the rules of fiction: David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. Last year, having never progressed beyond the book’s first chapter, I decided to mark this occasion with a personal commitment: by midnight on its birthday, I would give up membership to the ordinary world, and join the club of determined readers who have made it to the end of the novel.
At more than 1,000 pages – with copious footnotes – Infinite Jest is a famously difficult read. It is the Gen-X Ulysses that even those like me, who consider themselves DFW superfans, are nervous to attempt, many preferring to feed their devotion with his essays and short stories. Set in a North America of what was, in 1996, the near future, the novel follows a breathtaking number of characters. They are all somehow tied to the destiny of the Incandenza family and its youngest son, Hal, a tennis prodigy who, before the novel begins, finds his father’s body after a microwave-based suicide.




A lifelong apprenticeship: David Foster Wallace and Bryan A Garner on writing

The book, which launches the reader into its semi-dystopian world without really explaining its conditions or origins, requires monumental focus to even loosely follow, as it leaps between perspectives and locations, laughing in the face of stylistic continuity. Practically daring your eyes not to cross, Wallace deals language like a mad, drunk croupier, mixing the book’s hyper-detailed narratives with film script dialogue, lists, stream-of-consciousness, archived correspondence, and large portions of pure information whose closest relatives are found in product manuals and data reports.
All that, plus footnotes.
Being the sort of Millennial that Wallace predicted and would have found amusing, my first action was to start a Facebook group, asking other fans to join me in my challenge. Most people accepted my invitation with a cautious “I’ll see what I can do, no promises … ”, but one response, from the writer Joe Dunthorne, made me nervous. “I’ve done my time with that book,” he wrote, “I’m not ready for more.”
It was the tone usually reserved for the ex-lover who truly did a number on you, and it frightened me. Thinking about the few people I knew who had completed Infinite Jest, I realised that they shared a quality which, if I had to pin it down, seemed to relate to a past psychic wounding. Once, I could have attributed this to similar types of people enjoying certain authors. Now I worried that the book itself – or the task of reading it - had irreparably damaged them, and would do the same to me.
Joe gave me a few tips for my reading, pointing me towards support blogs and detailing a solution he had come up with for the issue of its physical size - sawing it into thirds. Walking into the living room one morning to see me hacking at the book with a kitchen knife, my boyfriend told me that I looked “completely crazy”. That was only the beginning.
In the weeks since, I’ve entered many stages. At first, I felt that I was lost in a strange, comma-less alternate universe, staring at pages like word jumbles, struggling to find the stories that they contained. Soon, I found that the alternate universe was very funny, and that, though I did not totally understand who all these people were, I was quite attached to them. I began to believe that my dreams were taking place in this other world, and I woke up missing the Incandenzas, reaching for the book before I reached for my phone. My social life disappeared, and my relationships suffered. Once, to my horror, I saw the word “Hugh” and thought of Hugh Steeply, the undercover agent, before I thought of Hugh Moss, my own father – whose house I was in, and whose name I was reading on a Wi-Fi network. 
Once a confidently fast reader, I found myself reading at the pace of a person learning a foreign language. Thirty pages took an hour, after which I required a break. My eyesight began to deteriorate, and any difficult or technical work outside of my reading felt like an affront to my brain, which was definitely hurting. At one point, Marta Bausells, a member of my reading group, emailed to say that the first 50 pages had put her in bed with a fever. 
The mental pain, I suspected, was a symptom of my mind adapting to the world of Subsidised Time and, as my reading began to feel more natural, I began to understand how the characters were connected. Despite its complex appearance, the book was simply showing me what it was to be human, so while my head throbbed, my heart fell wide open. When James Incandenza’s ghost muses about the futility of the extras’ lives in the TV show Cheers, and how he wanted to make films where every character had an audible voice, I began to see Infinite Jest for what it is: Wallace’s attempt to tell us that we are all important, we are all desperate, we are all broken, that all our fathers and mothers are the roots of our pain, and that all our addictions are overwhelming. 
Reading the book 20 years after it was published means that, as characters “eliminated” their “maps”, or considered doing so, I knew that the author had eventually been unable to resist his own suicidal urges. I wondered if, in 1996, people most identified Wallace with Hal, the young protagonist often described as the Hamlet of the novel – a frequent allusion in the book. Now, there is no doubt that Wallace’s lingering presence in the world most mirrors the charismatic legacy of James Incandenza, the “infinite jester”, who leaves behind a piece of entertainment so potent that those who come across it are permanently changed.




Why David Foster Wallace should not be worshipped as a secular saint

Today, I turned the last page of Infinite Jest, around a week late for my deadline. My copy of the book is sawn in three, abused, with smudges of food across its pages, from when I couldn’t stop for meals. At times, I couldn’t respect the book enough to look after it, for fear of losing focus. At times I hated it, daydreaming of the lovely, comprehensible books I would read when all this was finally over, even feeling a pang of desire when I thought I’d move on to Hamlet; in that moment, Hamlet felt like a holiday. Now I know that I’m simply going to start again, with the anniversary edition released on 23 February.
If you decide to join me in finishing this extraordinary work, I have only one piece of advice: persevere. It’ll be a slog, but around the point where it starts making sense, you will read these words:




 

But you never know when the magic will descend on you. You never know when the grooves will open up. And once the magic descends you don’t want to change even the smallest detail. You don’t know what concordance of factors and variables yields that calibrated can’t-miss feeling, and you don’t want to soil the magic by trying to figure it out, but you don’t want to change your grip, your stick, your side of the court, your angle of incidence to the sun.


Wallace is describing exactly what is happening to you.
