				Welcome to Lakin, Kansas			
									
					
		
	
	
		
								
		The City of Lakin was founded in 1873 by John O' Loughlin to serve the needs of the pioneer spirit sweeping the nation. The O'Loughlin trading post was established to accommodate the passengers using the A.T. & S.F. rail service and pioneers traveling by wagon on the Santa Fe Trail.
The city was named after David Long Lakin, who was a trustee for the railroad company.  Since 1894, Lakin has served as the county seat of Kearny County.
Lakin offers residents great schools, public facilities, fantastic year round recreation opportunities and state of the art healthcare.
Currently, Lakin's population as of the 2018 Census is 2,181 and Kearny County's is 4,026.
