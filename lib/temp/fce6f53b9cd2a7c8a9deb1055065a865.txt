JavaScript MVC Frameworks: Backbone, Ember and Angular JS – The paradigm shift and the impact on application development

Read the Question and Answers that were discussed during the webinar (PDF -378Kb)
In this fast paced world, how many users would like to stare at loading screen or the spinning wheel, while the request or process is being completed? If your answer is “None”, you are spot on. The application developers work does not get easier with the myriad range of devices they need to cater to. We already have desktops, laptops,tablets, smartphones, smart TVs and adding further to this complexity are the distinctive characteristics of these devices like screen size, operating system, computing power, limited battery life, storage and many more.
This leaves the developers to make variety of decisions regarding application compatibility, performance, usability and maintainability. One also needs to ensure that the application is scalable to meet future goals and needs of an organization.
Here is where JavaScript frameworks come to the rescue; many of them work on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design, thus enabling you to focus on making your applications rich and engaging rather than on their code structure and maintenance.
However, with the large number of JavaScript frameworks available, it can become a nightmare on the development team to choose the right framework for their web app development.
